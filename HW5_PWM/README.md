# HW5 PWM
This program creates a soft, gradual LED blink effect. The light slowly transitions from being very dim to reaching its full brightness and then gradually fades back to darkness. This effect is achieved by making subtle adjustments to the duty cycle of a series of high-frequency PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals.
