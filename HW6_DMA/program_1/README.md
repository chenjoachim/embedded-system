# (a)Modify trigger frequency
Set period from `2000 - 1` to `200000 - 1`.  
The period is 100 times longer than before.  
The frequency is 100 times lower than before.
# (b)Modify sampling time
Set sampling time from `ADC_SAMPLETIME_2CYCLES_5`(2.5 ADC clock cycles) to `ADC_SAMPLETIME_247CYCLES_5`(247.5 ADC clock cycles).
